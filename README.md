## Tutorial
1. Choose your game folder path 
2. Browse in the treenode view through your folders, until you find your desired igz file
3. Click on it and it auto converts it to the folder where your chosen igz file lies.
4. Optionally you can turn on with Skeleton but it is unimplemented (lol) <br> 
Also you can open the folder where your igz file is located by pressing "Open in Explorer" (a new explorer window will open)
